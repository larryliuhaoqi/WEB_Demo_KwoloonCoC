<h1>History</h1>
  <p>In 1998, the Society set up a second social service unit, 
which was sponsored by the Kowloon Chamber of Commerce. 
It was named as the "Kowloon City Chamber of Commerce Senior Citizens' Association", 
and the elderly were more willing to volunteer for the elderly and 
to encourage community participation, play a part of the old.</p>
